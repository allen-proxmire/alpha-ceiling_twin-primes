## Overview
This project presents a short research note introducing the **Alpha Ceiling**: a geometric property of consecutive primes based on "prime triangles."  

### Key Ideas
- **Prime Triangle:** Right triangle formed from a consecutive prime pair \((p_n, p_{n+1})\).  
- **Alpha Angle (Î±):** Defined as \(\alpha = \arctan(p_n / p_{n+1})\).  
- **Twin Prime Ceiling:** For any twin prime pair \((p_n, p_n+2)\), all consecutive primes between it and the next twin have strictly smaller Î± values. Thus, **twin primes set local Î±-ceilings.**

### Main Result
- **Lemma:** If \((p_n, p_n+2)\) is a twin prime and \((p_k, p_k+g_k)\) is any later consecutive prime pair, then  
  \[
  \alpha_k > \alpha_n \;\;\Rightarrow\;\; p_k > \tfrac{p_n g_k}{2}.
  \]  
- **Remark:** By Bertrandâ€“Chebyshevâ€™s theorem, there is always a prime before this threshold, so primes always have the *opportunity* not to break the ceiling.  
- **Computations:** Verified up to large bounds, showing no ceiling violations. Twin primes are the only Î±-record breakers in all checked ranges.  

### Conjecture
The **Twin Prime Î±-Ceiling Conjecture** states that twin primes always set unbroken Î±-ceilings until the next twin prime appears.
