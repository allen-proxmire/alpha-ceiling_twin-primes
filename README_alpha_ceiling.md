## Overview
This project presents a research note exploring the **Alpha Ceiling**: a geometric property of consecutive primes based on **prime triangles**.  

## Key Ideas
- **Prime Triangle:** Right triangle formed from a consecutive prime pair (pn, pn+1).  
- **Alpha Angle (Î±):** Defined as Î± = arctan(pn / pn+1).  
- **Twin Prime Ceiling:** For any twin prime pair (pn, pn+2), all consecutive primes between it and the next twin have strictly smaller Î± values. Twin primes thus set local **Î±-ceilings**.  

## Main Results
- **Lemma (Î±-Ceiling Lemma):**  
  If (pn, pn+2) is a twin prime and (pk, pk+gk) is any later consecutive prime pair, if  
  Î±k > Î±n, then
  pk > (pn)(gk)/2. 

  *Remark:* By Bertrandâ€“Chebyshevâ€™s theorem, there is always a prime below this threshold, giving primes the *opportunity* not to break the ceiling.  

- **Computations:** Verified up to large bounds, showing no ceiling violations. Twin primes are the only Î±-record breakers in all checked ranges.  

## Conjectures
1. **Twin Prime Î±-Ceiling Conjecture**  
   Twin primes always set unbroken Î±-ceilings until the next twin prime appears.  
   For any consecutive prime pair (pk, pk+1) occurring between twin primes (pn, pn+2) and (pm, pm+2), the Î±-angle satisfies  
   Î±k â‰¥ Î±n.
    
   That is, **no intermediate consecutive prime pair exceeds the Î±-angle of the preceding twin prime**

2. **Twin Prime Gap Bound Conjecture**  
    For any twin prime pair (pn, pn + 2) with pn > 5, let (pm, pm + 2) be the next twin prime pair. Then
pm âˆ’ pn â‰¤ pn.

   Equivalently, **the distance between consecutive twin primes never exceeds the smaller twinâ€™s first prime** for pn > 5
