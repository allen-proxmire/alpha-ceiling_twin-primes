## Overview
This project presents a research note exploring the **Alpha Ceiling**: a geometric property of consecutive primes based on **prime triangles**.  

## Key Ideas
- **Prime Triangle:** Right triangle formed from a consecutive prime pair \((p_n, p_{n+1})\).  
- **Alpha Angle (Î±):** Defined as \(\alpha = \arctan(p_n / p_{n+1})\).  
- **Twin Prime Ceiling:** For any twin prime pair \((p_n, p_n+2)\), all consecutive primes between it and the next twin have strictly smaller Î± values. Twin primes thus set local **Î±-ceilings**.  

## Main Results
- **Lemma (Î±-Ceiling Lemma):**  
  If \((p_n, p_n+2)\) is a twin prime and \((p_k, p_k+g_k)\) is any later consecutive prime pair, then  
  \[
  \alpha_k > \alpha_n \;\;\Rightarrow\;\; p_k > \frac{p_n g_k}{2}.
  \]  
  *Remark:* By Bertrandâ€“Chebyshevâ€™s theorem, there is always a prime below this threshold, giving primes the *opportunity* not to break the ceiling.  

- **Computations:** Verified up to large bounds, showing no ceiling violations. Twin primes are the only Î±-record breakers in all checked ranges.  

## Conjectures
1. **Twin Prime Î±-Ceiling Conjecture**  
   Twin primes always set unbroken Î±-ceilings until the next twin prime appears.  

2. **Second Î±-Ceiling Conjecture**  
   For any consecutive prime pair \((p_k, p_{k+1})\) occurring between twin primes \((p_n, p_n+2)\) and \((p_m, p_m+2)\), the Î±-angle satisfies  
   \[
   \alpha_k \le \alpha_n.
   \]  
   That is, **no intermediate consecutive prime pair exceeds the Î±-angle of the preceding twin prime**.
